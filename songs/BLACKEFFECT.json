  "lyrics": "Can you tell us about love? Hmm, well there's love of children Love of self Love of God Love of a partner All of them have a different shape But all of them is the same in the end It's about sensitivity, it's about passion It's about unconditional giving of self to another person And there's love of humanity That's the love that is right now needed most Love of humanity But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul It's like when you take some eggs and break them And you take the shells and mix them up Trying to find the ones that match And you find the perfect match When you find the perfect match That compatibility results in passion Results in unconditional giving of self I'm good on any MLK Boulevard I'm good on any MLK Boulevard See my vision with a TEC, bitch, I'm Malcolm X Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX Get your hands up high like a false arrest Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test Now hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest This Off-White fit that I rock, shit permanent Hmm, the fro that I grow got no perm in it Hmm, a nigga late but he best dressed Got slowed down by the weight of my necklaces Parked the Lexus in the projects, bitch I'm reckless Extra magazine hopped on a jet with my Ebony chick Blacker than the Essence fest The behind the back pass is so effortless LeBron James to you Omaroses Dapper Dan at 4AM, shit, I am the culture I made my own waves so now they’re anti-Tidal I’m livin' the no sock life despite you Since the Kalief doc, they've been at my neck Y'all can tell 'em Trayvon is comin' next The SEC, the FBI or the IRS I pass the alphabet boys like an eye test I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (I'm good) I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (He good) See my vision with a TEC, bitch, I'm Malcolm X (I'm Malcolm X) Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX (Yeah) Get your hands up high like a false arrest (put your hands up high) Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test (let me see 'em up high) Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test Put your hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest Higher, higher Higher, higher Higher, Higher Higher, higher Higher I'm good anywhere I go, anywhere I go (go) I pull up like the Freedom Riders, hop out on Rodeo Stunt with your curls, your lips, Sarah Baartman hips Gotta hop into my jeans like I hop into my whip yeah Mobbin' in a hoodie like Melo Come up out that pretty motherfucker like Hello, Hello I will never let you shoot the nose off my Pharaoh I like purple and purple rain Tryin' to put red and blue together, bitch, that's on gang These people tryna get me out the paint 'Cause I cook collard greens and yams better than your aunt Man, we started with a mustard seed Now we in the gray 911 with the mustard seats Sheesh! Matte black puma jet Shining my light on the world just like "UMI Says" Got the Richard Mille all colors Might hit you with the Rose Gold all summer For the culture They even biting cornrows, put your scarecrows up I come from the finest crop Tell em the god's on row, watch them line the block The Chitlin' circuit is stopped Now we in stadiums, Eighty Thou a wop, Watch I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (He good) I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (We good) See my vision with a TEC, bitch, I'm Malcolm X (I'm Malcom X) Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX (Yeah) Get your hands up high like a false arrest (Get your hands up high like a false arrest) Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test (Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test) Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test (Yes, put em up, this is not a test) Now hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest I know I've only come half the way But looking the mirror I see an older me Not realizing all the years that passed away But I know I've only come half the way",
